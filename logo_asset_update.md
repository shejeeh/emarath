# Logo Asset Update

## Changes Implemented
- **File Renaming**: Renamed `assets/COLOUR WATER MARK 01.jpg.jpeg` to `assets/logo_main.jpg`.
- **Code Update**: Updated `index.html` (navbar and footer) to reference `assets/logo_main.jpg`.

## Notes
- The logo appears to be a JPEG, which means it likely has a solid background (not transparent). This might look okay on the dark footer but may show a box on the light navbar.
- If you have a transparent PNG version, please provide that for a cleaner look on the white background.
