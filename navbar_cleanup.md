# Navigation Bar Cleanup

## Changes Implemented
- **Button Removal**: Removed the search icon button (`<div class="search-box">`) from the navigation bar.
- **Previous Changes**: Previously removed the "Book Consultation" button.

## Current State
- The navigation bar (`.nav-right`) now only contains the mobile menu button (`.mobile-menu-btn`), which is hidden on desktop.
- This results in a cleaner navigation bar with only the Logo/Company Name on the left and the Menu Links in the center (desktop).
